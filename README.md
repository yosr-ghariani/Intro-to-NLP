# Introduction to NLP

This repository consists of several notebooks, each exploring a distinct aspect of Natural Language Processing (NLP):

## 1째 Q&A with LLM
The objective is to build a system that retrieves relevant information from a textual database and generates responses to a query.

*Steps*:
*  Data Ingestion (using [The GALE ENCYCLOPEDIA of MEDICINE](https://www.academia.edu/32752835/The_GALE_ENCYCLOPEDIA_of_MEDICINE_SECOND_EDITION) as a dataset)
*  Implementation of Information Retrieval (RAG)
*  Chunking
*  Text Generation Using GPT-2


## 2째 Semantic analysis

This notebook demonstrates semantic similarity calculations between words using various embeddings:
* word2vec
* GloVe
* BERT with cosine similarity

## 3째 POS tagging

This notebook analyzes part-of-speech (POS) tags from the Brown Corpus and demonstrates tagging words using:

* Unigram Tagger
* Bigram Tagger
* Trigram Tagger

## 4째 Grammar tree (Syntax analysis)
This notebook discusses syntax analysis through two exercises:
